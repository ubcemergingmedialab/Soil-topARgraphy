  Question: 4.What roles does topography play in a formation of Organic soil?
  ResultText: 'Topography impacts development of Organic soils through restriction
    of water movement through the  profile. For example, topography (i.e. slope) will
    affect where water accumulates (e.g. in depressions) and that in turn prevents
    decomposition of organic matter which then accumulates. '
