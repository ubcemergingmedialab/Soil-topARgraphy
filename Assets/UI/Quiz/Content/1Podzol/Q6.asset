  Question: 6. What roles does topography play in a formation of Podzols?
  ResultText: Topography directly modifies soil water content & temperature, which
    then impacts physical and chemical weathering. Generally, weathering processes
    are the fastest in wet & warm regions, where the release of ions such as Fe and
    Al from crystalline structures is relatively fast (fast in geological terms, since
    this can take decades or hundreds of years). In wetter regions, these released
    Fe and Al oxides and hydroxides then are moving through soil profile and if they
    accumulate in B horizons a Bf horizon will form and that also means that a Podzol
    will form.
