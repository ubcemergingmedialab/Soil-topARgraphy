  Question: '4.Are Chernozems typical soils in forest ecosystems? '
  ResultText: 'Chernozems are typical soils of *grassland* ecosystems, which occur
    in dry (arid & semi-arid) regions, dominated by grass species. Grasses are providing
    abundant organic residues, and these residues tend to accumulate in these dry
    ecosystems, which leads to accumulation of organic matter in soil (typical soil
    formation process of Chernozems) '
