  Question: 5.What roles does topography play in a formation of Solonetz?
  ResultText: Topography does not have a pronounced, direct role in development of
    Solonetz. It indirectly may impact weathering of soil minerals and release of
    sodium ions from crystalline structure; and once those accumulate in B horizon,
    Bn is formed and so is the Solonetz.
