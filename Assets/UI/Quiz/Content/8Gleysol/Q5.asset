  Question: 5.What roles does topography play in a formation of Gleysols?
  ResultText: Topography can directly impact soil water content. In depressions, soils
    generally tend to be wetter than on steep slopes, since water tends to accumulate
    within soil in depressions. This in turn, leads to saturation and reducing conditions.
    Once water drains out (e.g. during warm part of a year) reducing conditions within
    the soil are replaced by oxidizing conditions. If these changes are occurring
    on a continuous basis, minerals such as Fe & Al oxides are changing oxidizing
    and reducing states and this is typical for gleying soil formation process.
