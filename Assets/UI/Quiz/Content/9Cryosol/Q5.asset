  Question: 5. What roles does topography play in a formation of Cryosol?
  ResultText: Topography does not have a pronounced, direct role in development of
    Cryosol. It may *indirectly* help through slope, since water will accumulate in
    depressions and then in a very cold climate that water will freeze. And if it
    stays frozen for the most of a year, the soil is Cryosol.
  FailedText: Incorrect, try again!
