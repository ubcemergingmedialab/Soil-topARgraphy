  Question: 3.Do all clay minerals shrink and swell (i.e., change volume) with changing
    soil water content?
  ResultText: Note, only clay minerals of the smectite group (e.g. clay mineral montmoriollinite)
    are capable of shrinking and swelling. They do that since interlayer bonds, in
    their crystalline structure, are weak and incoming water molecules (under wet
    conditions) push apart adjacent layers within their crystalline structure.
