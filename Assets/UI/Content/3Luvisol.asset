  Title: Luvisol
  Description:
  - "Luvisols are characterized a textural contrast between the A and the B horizon
    \u2013 the Ae horizon has less clay than the Bt horizon. This difference in clay
    content between the two horizons is presumed to arise from the physical transfer
    of clay (termed lessivage) from the Ae (eluvial) to the Bt (illuvial) horizon
    by vertically draining soil water."
