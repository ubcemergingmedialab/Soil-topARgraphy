  Title: Brunisol
  Description:
  - "These soils have enough horizon development to exclude them from Regosols, but
    lack sufficient development required for other soil orders. Brunisols are a stage
    in an evolutionary sequence that begins with an unweathered parent material (Regosolic
    soils) and ends with development of a \u201Cmature\u201D soil (e.g., Podzol).
    Several horizon types are used as diagnostic horizons for the Brunisols  (although
    all must be at least 5 cm thick), including Bm (a horizon that has undergone minimal
    pedogenic alteration), Bfj, Btj, and Bhjfj."
