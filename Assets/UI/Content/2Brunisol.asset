  Title: Brunisol
  Description:
  - "Brunisols have enough horizon development to exclude them from Regosols but lack
    sufficient development required for other soil orders. Brunisolic soils can be
    viewed as a stage in an evolutionary sequence that begins with an unweathered
    parent material (Regosolic soils) and ends with development of a \u201Cmature\u201D
    soil (e.g., of the Podzolic or Luvisolic orders). Several horizon types are used
    as diagnostic horizons for the Brunisolic order (although all must be at least
    5 cm thick). The main horizon associated with the Brunisolic order is the Bm horizon
    (a horizon that has undergone minimal pedogenic alteration), while others include
    Bfj, Btj, and Bhjfj."
