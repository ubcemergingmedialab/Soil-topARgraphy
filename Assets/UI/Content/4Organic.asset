  Title: Organic
  Description:
  - "Soils in this order are composed primarily of organic matter and include soils
    commonly known as peat, bog or fen soils. Most of these soils are saturated with
    water for prolonged periods of time. Organic soils contain >17% organic C (or
    >30% organic matter) by weight. Organic soils are the dominant wetland soils found
    in forested regions of Canada, but they also occur in non-wetland positions in
    upland sites where leaf litter accumulates.\r\nThe master horizon for the wetland
    Organic soils is the O horizon, distinguished by 3 decomposition stages of organic
    material (Of, Om, and Oh). The upland versions of the Organic order are composed
    of leaf litter and other woody debris, which are termed folic materials. These
    organic horizons are assigned an L, F, or H designation, depending again on the
    degree of decomposition.\r\n"
