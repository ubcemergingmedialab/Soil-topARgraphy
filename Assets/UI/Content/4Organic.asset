  Title: Organic
  Description:
  - Soils in this order are composed primarily of organic mater and include soils
    commonly known as peat, bog or fen soils. Most of these soils are saturated with
    water for prolonged periods of time. Organic soils contain 17% organic C (or 30%
    organic matter) by weight. Soils of the Organic order are the dominant wetland
    soils found in forested regions of Canada but they also occur in non-wetland positions
    in upland sites where leaf litter accumulates.
