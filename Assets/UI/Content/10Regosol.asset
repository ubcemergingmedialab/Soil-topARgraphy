  Title: Regosol
  Description:
  - Regosols are weakly developed soils to meet the classification requirements of
    other soil orders. They lack a recognizable B horizon (i.e., B horizon is less
    than 5 cm thick). Soils of the Regosolic order are most commonly associated with
    landforms where the land surface is (or has recently been) unstable. Because of
    the unstable surface, the soil has had a limited time to develop. Consequently,
    soil horizons are very thin if present at all.
