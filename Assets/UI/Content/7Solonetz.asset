  Title: Solonetz
  Description:
  - "Solonetzic soils occur in the same ecozones as Chernozemic soils. These soils
    are characterized by low (exchangeable) calcium to magnesium ratio. The diagnostic
    horizon is a Bn (or Bnt), which is very hard when dry and which swells and becomes
    relatively impermeable when wet.\r"
  - There are four great groups of the Solonetzic order. Three of them represent an
    idealized evolutionary sequence, which begins with soil with a Bn horizon (Solonetz
    great group). Sodium-enhanced clay translocation begins, creating an Ae and a
    Bnt horizon (Solodized Solonetz great group). When the upper Bnt is altered by
    the weathering processes outlined above, the soils are placed into the Solod great
    group. In soils formed in parent material high in clay (typically > 60% clay)
    the Ae/Bnt sequence may be weakly expressed and those soils are classified into
    the Vertic Solonetz great group.
