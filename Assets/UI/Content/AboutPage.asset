  Title: About Soil TopARgraphy
  Description:
  - "Soil TopARgraphy is a mobile app designed for students in the Introduction to
    Soil Science courses, who are learning about effects of topography on soil formation.
    The app allows students to view and learn about distribution of different soil
    orders through an immersive and visual Augmented Reality (AR) terrain, using area
    north of Kamloops, British Columbia as an example.\r\n\nThe app was originally
    developed for the University of British Columbia students, but since it addresses
    universal principles of soil formation, it could also be used in any other Introduction
    to Soil Science courses around the world. For more information, please visit eml.ubc.ca/projects/soil-topargraphy/
    or contact Dr. Maja Krzic at maja.krzic@ubc.ca. \n"
