  Title: Gleysol
  Description:
  - "**NOTE: there are no Gleysols near Kamloops, BC, it is added to the map to complete
    description of 10 soil orders of the Canadian classification system. **\r\n\nThese
    soils have undergone prolonged periods of intermittent or continuous saturation
    with water causing reducing conditions during their genesis. This results in characteristic
    colours and mottling. Water saturation leads to depletion of oxygen in the soil
    and cause the transformation of metals such as iron. When oxygen is present, iron
    is oxidized and has a reddish colour, while when oxygen becomes depleted (due
    to water saturation) the iron is reduced and takes on a blue-grey hue and this
    dominates the colour of the horizon. The diagnostic criteria for Gleysols is the
    presence of well-developed gley features within 50 cm of the soil surface (e.g.,
    Bg, Cg).\r\nIn subhumid regions, Gleysols occur commonly in shallow depressions
    and on level lowlands that are saturated with water every spring. In more humid
    areas, they may also occur on slopes and on undulating terrain.\r\n"
