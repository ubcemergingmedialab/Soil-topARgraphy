  Title: Gleysol
  Description:
  - Gleysols are soils that have undergone prolonged periods of intermittent or continuous
    saturation with water causing reducing conditions during their genesis. This results
    in characteristic colours and mottling. Water saturation leads to depletion of
    oxygen in the soil and cause the transformation of metals such as iron. When oxygen
    is present, iron is oxidized and has a reddish colour, while when oxygen becomes
    depleted (due to water saturation) the iron is reduced and takes on a blue-grey
    hue and this dominates the colour of the horizon. The diagnostic criteria for
    Gleysolic soils in the presence of well-developed gley features within 50 cm of
    the soil surface. Horizons with these features are labelled with the subscript
    g (e.g., Bg, Aeg, Cg)
