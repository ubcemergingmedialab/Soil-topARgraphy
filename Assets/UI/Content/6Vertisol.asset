  Title: Vertisol
  Description:
  - "\rVertisols are heavy textured soils (with \u2265 60% clay) with shrink-swell
    characteristics. They lack the horizon development diagnostic of other horizons.
    Slickenslides and argillipedoturbation (disruption and mixing caused by shrink-swell
    of the soil mass) are diagnostic features of these soils. The horizons that result
    from this mixing are inverted of material and are called vertic horizons (e.g.,
    Bv, Cv). As a mass of soil is displaced along a crack, the face of the mass can
    become very smooth and polished and these polished surfaces are called slickenslides.
    The horizons in which slickenslides are Bss, Ckss, or Cgss."
