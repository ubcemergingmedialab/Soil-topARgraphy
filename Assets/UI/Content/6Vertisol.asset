  Title: Vertisol
  Description:
  - "Vertisols are characterized by having \u2265 60% clay with shrink-swell characteristics.
    Slickenslides and argillipedoturbation (disruption and mixing caused by shrink-swell
    of the soil mass) are diagnostic features of these soils. The horizons that result
    from this mixing are inverted of material and are called vertic horizons (e.g.,
    Bv, Cv). As a mass of soil is displaced along a crack, the face of the mass can
    become very smooth and polished and these polished surfaces are called slickenslides.
    The horizons in which slickenslides occur are Bss, Ckss, or Cgss. Vertisols mainly
    occur in the cool, subarid to subhumid, grassland portion of the Interior Plains
    of western Canada."
