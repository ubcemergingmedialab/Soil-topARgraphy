  Title: Podzol
  Description:
  - Podzolic soils are forested soils found primarily on sandy deposits in ecozones
    (or parts of ecozones) where the mean annual precipitation is above 700 mm. Coniferous-dominated
    plant communities are the major vegetation type found on Podzolic soils. Podzolic
    soils have B horizons that are enriched with amorphous material composed of humified
    organic matter, aluminum and iron. These soils generally have organic surface
    horizons, a light coloured eluvial horizon (which may be absent), and a reddish
    to black B horizon with an abrupt upper boundary.
