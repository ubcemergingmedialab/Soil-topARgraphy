  Title: Podzol
  Description:
  - "These soils are typically found in coniferous forests located on coarse deposits
    in regions with the mean annual precipitation >700 mm. Podzols have B horizons
    that are enriched with amorphous material composed of well-decomposed organic
    matter, aluminum and iron (i.e., Bf, Bhf, Bh). These soils generally have organic
    surface horizons, a light coloured eluvial horizon (which may be absent), and
    a reddish to very dark, almost black B horizon with an abrupt upper boundary.\r\n"
