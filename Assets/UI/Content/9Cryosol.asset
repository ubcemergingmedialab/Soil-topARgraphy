  Title: Cryosol
  Description:
  - "** Disclaimer: In reality, this soil order is located outside of Kamloop.  We
    placed it here to reflect the elevation and let you read its information.** \nSoils
    of this order have permafrost either within 1 m of the surface or within 2 m if
    the pedon is strongly cryoturbated in the active layer.  They form in regions
    that have a mean annual soil temperature below 0\xB0C. Cryosols occupy much of
    the northern third of Canada."
