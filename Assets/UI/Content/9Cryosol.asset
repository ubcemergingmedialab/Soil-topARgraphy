  Title: Cryosol
  Description:
  - "**NOTE: there are no Cryosolis near Kamloops, BC, it is added to the map to complete
    description of 10 soil orders of the Canadian classification system. ** \r\n\nSoils
    of this order have permafrost either within 1 m of the surface or within 2 m if
    the pedon is strongly cryoturbated (mixed due to freezing and thawing) in the
    active layer.  They form in regions that have a mean annual soil temperature below
    0\xB0C. Cryosols occupy much of the northern Canada where permafrost exists close
    to the surface of both mineral and organic deposits. Cryosols predominate north
    of the tree line, are common in the subarctic forests in fine-textured soils,
    and extend into the boreal forest in some organic materials and into some alpine
    areas of mountainous regions.\r\n"
