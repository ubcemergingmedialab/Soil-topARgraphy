  Title: General
  Description:
  - "Index of Elevation: \n- Green: ~400 m \n- Yellow: ~600 m \n- Orange ~800 m \n-
    Red: ~1000 m \n\nTopography refers to the configuration of the land's surface,
    and it incorporates relative differences in elevation, aspect, and the general
    shape and connectivity of land surfaces. Topography affects soil development through
    slope gradient (which impacts run-off, percolation, and mass movement) and modification
    of microclimate (i.e., solar radiation, precipitation, and wind). \r\nFor example,
    soils on the side of hills tend to be shallow, due to frequent movement of soil
    material along the slope, while soils on the top of hills tend to be deep, but
    lighter in color, due to downward leaching losses. Soils in the valleys are often
    deeper, darker, and contain more horizons. This is due to material deposition
    from hillside erosion, material accumulation from downward leaching from the tops
    of hills, and water accumulation in the low lying areas.\r"
