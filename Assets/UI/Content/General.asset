  Title: General
  Description:
  - "Soil TopARgraphy is a mobile app designed for students in the Introduction to
    Soil Science courses, who are learning about effects of topography on soil formation.
    The app allows students to view and learn about distribution of different soil
    orders through an immersive and visual Augmented Reality (AR) terrain, using area
    north of Kamloops, British Columbia as an example.\r\nThe app was originally developed
    for the University of British Columbia students, but since it addresses universal
    principles of soil formation, it could also be used in any other Introduction
    to Soil Science courses around the world. For more information, please visit eml.ubc.ca/projects/soil-topargraphy/
    or contact Dr. Maja Krzic at maja.krzic@ubc.ca. "
  - "Index of Elevation: \n- Green: ~400 m \n- Yellow: ~600 m \n- Orange ~800 m \n-
    Red: ~1000 m \n\nTopography refers to the configuration of the land's surface,
    and it incorporates relative differences in elevation, aspect, and the general
    shape and connectivity of land surfaces. Topography affects soil development through
    slope gradient (which impacts run-off, percolation, and mass movement) and modification
    of microclimate (i.e., solar radiation, precipitation, and wind). \r\nFor example,
    soils on the side of hills tend to be shallow, due to frequent movement of soil
    material along the slope, while soils on the top of hills tend to be deep, but
    lighter in color, due to downward leaching losses. Soils in the valleys are often
    deeper, darker, and contain more horizons. This is due to material deposition
    from hillside erosion, material accumulation from downward leaching from the tops
    of hills, and water accumulation in the low lying areas.\r\n"
