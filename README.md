## Project Description: 
Using the power of augmented reality, “Soil TopARgraphy” showcases the relative heights and environments of soil orders beyond numbers and descriptions. Augmented Reality is a technology that overlays digital enhancements on top of existing reality through your phone. With the app, students in UBC’s APBI 200 class learn about soil orders in Kamloop, B.C by viewing and manipulating a terrain model. They can view the model in either with a photorealistic satellite image model or a color-coded heightmap. Flags mark locations with different soils that students can tap to: read about the soil, see images, watch a video, and take a quiz to reflect upon their understanding. This gamifies and adds interactivity to the classroom to promote student engagement and deeper comprehension of materials.
